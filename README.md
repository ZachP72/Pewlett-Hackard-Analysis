# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This project was created in order to see which employees are on pace to retire soon due to age which helps determine the number of employees that the company will need to hire. This also provides data as to which title each of these retiring employees has giving more information as to what roles need people in them. Lastly there is a mentorship program that will be created and the analysis provided us with employees who are eligible to participate within the program. 

## Results
As a result of the analysis we found out how many people of each department were leaving and we found out that the Development department (d005) is losing 9,281 employees to retirment. That department is losing the most while the department losing the least is d002 otherwise known as Finance. The total of retirees is 36,619 for all departments. Of those retiring people used different titles. The two largest titles that will be retiring are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff members. The title with the fewest members retiring is Manager at 2. The issue we are faced with is what percentage of the company held these titles and what are the steps to refil these potitions. 

## Summary 
Stated in the previous paragraph above Pewlett Hackard will need to replace 36,619 employees because of the "silver tsunami". We will have plenty of retirement-ready employees in the departments to help mentor the next generation. This will provide the next generation with a great support system ready for them to excel within their fields.
